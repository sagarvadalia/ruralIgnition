  <h2>Who We Are</h2>
  <p>Rural Ignition is a nonprofit organization aimed at providing modern engineering solutions to problems in the developing world.</p>
  <p>For our first project, we aim to alleviate the global indoor air pollution crisis, which affects an estimated 3 billion people. The problem stems from solid biomass fuel (wood, dung, and refuse)cooking practices leading to smoke inhalation in homes.</p>
  <p>Our target is rural Sri Lanka, where nearly 16 million Sri Lankans use unventilated cook stoves and over 4,000 die annually due to respiratory illness caused by indoor air pollution. </p>

  <h2>Our Business Model</h2>
  <p>We have assembled a network of engineers and NGOs to design, manufacture and implement a clean cookstove solution, specifically catered to the needs of the community.</p>
  <p>It is our goal to engage the communities who would be served by our stove, and integrate their feedback into the design process.</p>
  <p>Additionally, the stove would be manufactured in the communities it would serve via collective microfactories supplied and managed by our NGO partners in the region. The stove would then by sold on a graduated price scale appropriate for the specific community’s economic status. The stoves would also be available for wholesale purchase by NGO’s wishing to provide entire communities with these lifesaving appliances.</p>
